**anagrams.py**  
Given a list of words, produce an algorithm that will return a list of all anagrams for a specific word

**find_missing_in_array.py**  
Given an array of positive numbers from 1 to n, such that all numbers from 1 to n are present except one number x. The input array is not sorted. Find x.

**find_sum_of_two.py**  
Given an array of integers and a value, determine if there are any two integers in the array whose sum is equal to the given value. 
Return true if the sum exists and return false if it does not.  
Array : 5 7 1 2 8 4 3  
Value : 10  
Return: True (7+3=10 or 2+8=10)  

**merge_sorted_linked_lists.py**  
Given two sorted linked lists, merge them so that the resulting linked list is also sorted.  
head1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 15 -> 19  
head2 -> 7 -> 9 -> 10 -> 16  
merged -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 15 -> 16 -> 19  

**string_segmentation.py**  
Given a dictionary of words and a large input string, find out whether the input string can be completely segmented into the words of a given dictionary.  
Dictionary: {apple, apple, pear, pie}  
String: applepie  --> True  
String: applepeer --> False
